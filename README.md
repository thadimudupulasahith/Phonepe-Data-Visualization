#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
- Technologies:
Github Cloning, Python, Pandas, MySQL,
mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.
- The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to
various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
- Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and
clone it..
- Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning
and pre-processing steps.
- Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and
retrieval.
- Create a live geo-visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python
to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
- Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
- Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different
facts and figures to display on the dashboard.
#### Approach:
1. Data extraction: Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the
Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV
or JSON.
2. Data transformation: Use a scripting language such as Python, along with
libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may
include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data
into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.
3. Database insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to
connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL
commands.
4. Dashboard creation: Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create
an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map
functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used
to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to
select different facts and figures to display.
5. Data retrieval: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the
MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in
the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.
6. Deployment: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test
the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it
accessible to users.
